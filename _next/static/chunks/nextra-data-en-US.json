Thermal runaway occurs when a Nozzle continues to receive power without raising the temperature as expected.\nHeatbreak\nThe heatbreak is the part of the nozzle where filament moves from a solid to molten plastic.\nThis is where the majority of extrusion issues occur. If the filament is heated too far past its transition point it can melt too far up the heatbreak resulting in a \"Jam\".\nHeatsink\nAn aluminum block meant to disperse heat and keep the filament solid until it reaches the melt zone\nHotend Cooling Fan\nNormally attached to the heatsink, removes heat before the \"melt zone\"\nThis is very important to the extrusion system, if this fan stops or is obstructed the hotend will jam.\nPart Cooling Fan\nThis component transitions the molten plastic from a molten state to a solid state\nSome materials require 100% fan and others may warp.
