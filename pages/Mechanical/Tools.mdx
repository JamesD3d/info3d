| [A set of metric allen wrenches](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=metric+allen+wrench+set&crid=2LIHK2QYVEI8Q&sprefix=heatse%2Caps%2C110&ref=nb_sb_ss_p13n-pd-dpltr-ranker_1_6) | the majority of 3D printers use metric allen wrenches to assemble and maintain the printer. Having a set of these on hand can be very helpful for making adjustments or repairs. |
| [Nozzle Block Cleaning Tool](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=nozzle+cleaning+tool&crid=2LIHK2QYVEI8Q&sprefix=heatse%2Caps%2C110&ref=nb_sb_ss_p13n-pd-dpltr-ranker_1_6) | a tool used to clean the nozzle of a 3D printer. It can help remove clogs or debris that may affect print quality. These are based on acupuncture needles and are used to clean the nozzle of a 3D printer. They can help remove clogs or debris that may affect print quality and are extremely sharp. |
| [Clog Poker](https://www.amazon.com/Creality-Official-Needles-Cleaning-Stainless/dp/B0D3HLTWF6/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=2YLWAVUWTGJCF&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.34wHQ-_QfiTdKSIuPT43I3Ob-yw8EWI9tR7sR-MZBS1HaHolWLdiC9pFyKJTPlC5Zsd9t7jFI0LtgV8neXb0RqlKYqcDznRFeiIrcFSjx048AABlyRuv9ADv3DN5lMWqnnwjQqzbzHbkSIjengfiVGL4QLfP-QE3li_bOAiBn1-b_KVj_JVVTcQjvnafqvZReO1ivtpcLvy9H8hNLBL_nXLoAF6ifOS5UNxaTHH1RvU.zCKb-2wX455laCxwcs50wQ14ZP_aRVAr8olSR_uMqss&dib_tag=se&keywords=3d%2Bprinter%2Bjam%2Btool&qid=1749130608&sprefix=3d%2Bprinter%2Bjam%2Btool%2Caps%2C95&sr=8-2-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1) | a tool used to clear clogs in the nozzle of a 3D printer. It can help ensure smooth filament flow and prevent print failures. |
| [3D Gloop](https://www.3dgloop.com/) | a specialized adhesive designed for 3D printed parts. It can be used to bond different types of plastics and is especially useful for repairing or reinforcing prints. <Callout type="warning"> Acetone-based glues do not work well with 3D printed parts. They can cause the plastic to become brittle and break down over time. It is best to use adhesives specifically designed for 3D printing materials. </Callout> |
| [Windex](https://www.amazon.com/Windex-Packaging-Designed-Breaking-Original/dp/B0CF3BDBL2/ref=sr_1_9?c=ts&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.FF4T3vazP5E_AymsYUlAX5HUwN0wuqehlj4Qlx_x8FJT7WAb6QtDP2MzRfBQiUnrAgADvsWJaP5NZKTmAuUEJ7PfGw-Pns1ta8c1vYk4sd2lF0u8ERsnabXu7gz5lW8E4H3bKazQ3BwHrujgd45dWzRnGBtTtG1MPAkHfxB7RzNuL7-Hg15STMP125rU3NIk2ZJr-bQ4Sy8JJJeJij5q7ZkozhNm8qVSnwdbq8yxSHdAeTh6BiATZ-4e7QmkqPBrZjRwNSTvx4pTC0RhAPI3UCHPnCUg27jURDAzgD5TVNY.Z25WtzdCy4qJsqMOapyJkoC_YEsjuunMTb7ZgU9ALmk&dib_tag=se&keywords=Household%2BCleaning&qid=1749728751&s=hpc&sr=1-9&ts_id=15342821&th=1) | a good cleaner to quickly clean a build plate after adhesion issues. |
| [Dawn Dish Soap](https://www.amazon.com/Dawn-Platinum-Powerwash-Starter-Bundle/dp/B082DLGV3F?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1) | warm water and dawn dish soap is a great way to deep clean a build plate removing all oils that may have caused issues. |
| [Bambu Liquid Glue](https://www.amazon.com/3DTOOLS-Original-Printer-Adhesive-Filament/dp/B0DFHS36TS/ref=asc_df_B0DFHS36TS?mcid=c62b9762c2c537999f64402c0385b93b&hvocijid=15382703202704483084-B0DFHS36TS-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=721245378154&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15382703202704483084&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=21171&hvtargid=pla-2281435178538&psc=1) | For certain materials an adhesive may be needed. This can be a release agent or to increase bed adhesion. This is my preferred solution but a standard glue stick works as well. A recommendation is to clean the build plate or wet a lint-free towel or disposable napkin to reactivate the glue between prints.|
