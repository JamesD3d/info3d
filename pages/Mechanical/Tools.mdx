| [Clog Poker](https://www.amazon.com/Creality-Official-Needles-Cleaning-Stainless/dp/B0D3HLTWF6/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=2YLWAVUWTGJCF&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.34wHQ-_QfiTdKSIuPT43I3Ob-yw8EWI9tR7sR-MZBS1HaHolWLdiC9pFyKJTPlC5Zsd9t7jFI0LtgV8neXb0RqlKYqcDznRFeiIrcFSjx048AABlyRuv9ADv3DN5lMWqnnwjQqzbzHbkSIjengfiVGL4QLfP-QE3li_bOAiBn1-b_KVj_JVVTcQjvnafqvZReO1ivtpcLvy9H8hNLBL_nXLoAF6ifOS5UNxaTHH1RvU.zCKb-2wX455laCxwcs50wQ14ZP_aRVAr8olSR_uMqss&dib_tag=se&keywords=3d%2Bprinter%2Bjam%2Btool&qid=1749130608&sprefix=3d%2Bprinter%2Bjam%2Btool%2Caps%2C95&sr=8-2-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1) | A tool used to clear clogs in the nozzle of a 3D printer. It can help ensure smooth filament flow and prevent print failures. |
| [3D Gloop](https://www.3dgloop.com/) | A specialized adhesive designed for 3D printed parts. It can be used to bond different types of plastics and is especially useful for repairing or reinforcing prints. <Callout type="warning"> Acetone-based glues do not work well with 3D printed parts. They can cause the plastic to become brittle and break down over time. It is best to use adhesives specifically designed for 3D printing materials. </Callout> |

| [Dawn Dish Soap](https://www.amazon.com/Dawn-Platinum-Powerwash-Starter-Bundle/dp/B082DLGV3F?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1) | Warm water and Dawn dish soap is a great way to deep clean a build plate, removing all oils that may have caused issues. |
| [Bambu Liquid Glue](https://www.amazon.com/3DTOOLS-Original-Printer-Adhesive-Filament/dp/B0DFHS36TS/ref=asc_df_B0DFHS36TS?mcid=c62b9762c2c537999f64402c0385b93b&hvocijid=15382703202704483084-B0DFHS36TS-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=721245378154&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15382703202704483084&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=21171&hvtargid=pla-2281435178538&psc=1) | For certain materials, an adhesive may be needed. This can be a release agent or used to increase bed adhesion. This is my preferred solution, but a standard glue stick works as well. It is recommended to clean the build plate or wet a lint-free towel or disposable napkin to reactivate the glue between prints.|
