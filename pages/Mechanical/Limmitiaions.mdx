# FDM 3D Printing Physical Limitations

<Callout type="info">
As a general rule, 3D printed models only retain ~40% strength in the Z axis due to layer adhesion.
</Callout>

## Curved Surfaces on the Z axis aka "Salmon Skin"
Causes: 
- Just like slicing an apple and putting those slices back together, FDM printing builds objects by layering plastic at set heights. Continuous curved surfaces are problematic in the Z axis.

Solutions: 
- Use Adaptive Layer Heights 
- Chamfers, not Fillets, on bottom layers.

## Overhangs 

Cause: 
- Gravity + Molten Plastic = issues

Solutions:
- 3D Printer Supports (see section of supports)
- Ensure the Model has no overhang greater than 45 degrees

## Printing in Thin Air


Cause:
- Gravity; Model has a region that is floating. 

Solution:
- If this is necessary, the only solution is to use supports.
