# Firmware

3D printers use microcontrollers to send individual movement commands to motors.

The resulting motion is movement in the X, Y, Z, and E (extrusion) axes.

There are three main firmware packages that manage these commands.  
> There are several manufacturer-specific options, such as Bambu, but most function very similarly. All listed are open source.

## [RepRap](https://configtool.reprapfirmware.org/)
- ![RepRap Firmware.webp](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/JamesD3d/info3dimages@main/i/Printers/ReoRap%20Firmware.webp)

- Primarily uses Duet control boards
- All settings controlled via G-code
- Uses the RepRap configurator
- Web-based control interface

## [Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/)
- ![Marlin.webp](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/JamesD3d/info3dimages@main/i/Printers/Marlin.webp)

- Used on multiple boards
- Uses VS Code and the PlatformIO extension to build firmware based on `config.h` and `configadv.h` files
- Has predetermined settings for most controllers and situations. [(Config References)](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/tree/import-2.1.x/config/examples)

## [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/)
- Klipper uses a separate MCU, such as a Raspberry Pi, to process and send commands to the microcontroller
- Configuration is based on a `printer.cfg` file [(Config Examples)](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/tree/master/config)
- A separate configuration is needed for the serial ID of the microcontroller in the `moonraker.cfg` file
- Web-based interface
- Can support multiple controllers
