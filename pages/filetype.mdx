## STL - StereoLithography, Standard Triangle Language

Commonly referred to as mesh files, STL files are 3D models that are composed of numerous triangles. STL files are widely used in 3D printing and computer-aided design (CAD) applications. They can represent complex geometries by approximating surfaces with triangular facets and are supported by most 3D printing software and hardware.

## OBJ - Wavefront Object

OBJ files are another type of mesh file format that can represent 3D geometry. They can include information about vertices, edges, and faces, as well as texture coordinates and normals. OBJ files are widely used in 3D modeling and animation software, and they can be easily exported and imported between different applications.

## 3MF - 3D Manufacturing Format

3MF is a newer file format designed specifically for 3D printing. It supports more advanced features than STL, such as color, texture, and material properties. 3MF files can also include metadata about the print job, such as print settings and support structures. This format is becoming increasingly popular in the 3D printing industry.   

## GCODE â€“ G-code is a command language 

[Breakdown G-code Example](/Gcode_Commands)  
G-code is used to control CNC machines, including 3D printers. It contains instructions for the printer to follow, such as movement commands, extrusion rates, and temperature settings. G-code files are generated by slicing software from 3D models and are essential for the actual printing process.

## STEP - Standard for the Exchange of Product Data

STEP is a file format used for representing 3D models and is commonly used in CAD applications. It allows for the exchange of product data between different software systems and is widely supported in the engineering and manufacturing industries. These files normally represent an assembly of adjustable "bodies" or parts.

## DWG - Drawing

DWG is a proprietary file format used by AutoCAD and other CAD software. It contains 2D and 3D design data, including geometry, annotations, and metadata. DWG files are widely used in architecture, engineering, and construction industries for creating detailed drawings and designs.

## DXF - Drawing Exchange Format

DXF is a file format developed by Autodesk for enabling data interoperability between different CAD software. It can represent 2D and 3D designs and is commonly used for sharing drawings and models across various applications.

## SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics

SVG is a vector graphics format that can represent 2D shapes and paths. While not specifically designed for 3D printing, SVG files can be used to create 2D designs that can be extruded or converted into 3D models using various software tools. SVG files are widely used in web design and graphic applications.

<Callout type="info">
 There are many more file types used in 3D modeling and printing, but these are some of the most common ones. Each file type has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which one to use depends on the specific requirements of the project and the software being used.
