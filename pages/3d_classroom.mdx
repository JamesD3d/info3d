# Education Recommendations for 3D Printing in the Classroom

3D Printing is an exciting technology that appears to be very engaging to students of many ages. 
When establishing a 3D printing program in the classroom, it is important to consider the following:

## Time:
- Depending on the printer, most objects of a small to medium size can take between 20 min - 2 hrs.
- This is dependent on the overall size, amount of supports, number of walls, and infill percentage.


 ## Hypothetical scenario:
 - An instructor with a class of 20 students. Assigns students to design and print a small model using tinkercad. The projected amount of time needed for each student print could range from 6 to 20 hours.
 if this instructor has 2 of these classes its evident that the amount of time needed is extensive. 


## Recommendations:
<Steps>
### Printer Selection
- Ideally an instructor would have access to multiple printers. A ratio of 5:1 is a good balance between the number of students and the number of devices needed to manage.

### Limits
- Limit the size and scope of the students models with design restrictions. Appropriate limitations and design restrictions can greatly improve the success of the project.

### Maximize build volume
- Depending on the size of the printer and the models size and area needed for supports, attempt to put more than one model on the print bed. This can decrease the amount of time between model completion. This will increase the time need to complete a job. This will also increase the chance of a failure.

## Model Management
- With a large number of models to manage per class it is important to have a system to track what has and hasn't been completed.

<Callout type="default">
  The Windows app [3D Viewer](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nblggh42ths?hl=en-US&gl=US) is a great tool to view 3D models in the file explorer preview pannel.

<Steps>
### Google Form
- To manage my classroom projects I selected google forms. This was a simple form that recoreded the students email address, class period, grade level, and does not allw students to submit the incorrect file format. 

### Lable Files
- Ensure that students label their downloaded model files with their name and class period.

### Increase File Size Limmet
- Ensure that the file size limmet is increased to allow for larger files. 

### Viewing Submissions
- Add a check box coloum before the students email address. 
> many districts have the option to convert student emails to "cards" with a friendly name. 

### Download the Models
- When you bengin to print the student .stl files you may choose to download individual files via the link provided in google sheets, or you may download all the files at once by downloading a .zip file of the google folder associated with the form. 

### Slice the Models
- Once all the files are downloaded with in slicers like bambu studio or Orca slicer you can load all the models at once. The slicer can auto arrainge all the classes models into an effchient layout. arrangment on multiplebuild plates. The files can then be sliced and printed in sequience. 

### Remove supports and clean up the models as needed.
<Callout type="warning">
  Be careful allowing students to remove supports. Small piece of plastic may break off violently and cause injury. I would recommend eye protection when removing supports.

- Rationale:

<Steps>
### Quality of Life
- The majority of the setup and calibration functions are automated, increasing print quality, reliability, and ease of use.
> including bed leveling, pressure advance, flow rate, resonance compensation, motor noise cancellation, and acceleration.

### Integrated slicer
- Bambu Studio is an open-source slicer with well-tuned printing profiles for all Bambu printers.

### Remote Management
- Bambu printers are managed via a web interface built into their slicer. This allows you to set a variety of filament parameters, trigger calibrations, as well as start, pause, and monitor prints in progress.

<Callout type="important">
  Remote connection and monitoring are available with the Bambu Studio mobile app and from within the slicer. All printers require Wi-Fi internet access for these features to function.
</Callout>

> These are not unique features to Bambu printers; however, this is a very well-integrated, full-stack solution that is easy to use and has a large community of users.
