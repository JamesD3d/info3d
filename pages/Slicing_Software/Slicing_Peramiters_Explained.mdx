## Quality
---
- [ ]  Layer height: 0.2 mm

- [ ]  First Layer height 0.2 mm

### Line Width
---
- In most cases I update these to 0.6 mm this is 120% of the nozzle size and can reduce print time and increase strength.

-  [ ] For detail and text I leave the default settings.

### Seam Position
---
- [ ] Aligned / Rear

- [ ] Scarf joint on all seams.

### Wall Generator
---
- [ ] Arachne

### Walls and surfaces 
---
- [ ] Inner/Outer/Inner

- [ ] Small area flow compensation(beta)

### Bridging 
---
- [ ] Thick external bridges

- [ ] Thick internal bridges

- [ ] Extra bridge layers(beta)

Bridge counterbore holes
- [ ] Sacrificial layer 
    > also helps with support removal.

### Overhangs
---
- [ ] Extra perimeters on overhangs.


## Strength 
---

### Wall Loops:
---  
> I increase this for desired strength.
- [ ] Wall Loops : 3

- [ ] Alternate Extra Walls


### Top/Bottom Shells
- [ ] Top shell layers: 5

- [ ] Top shell thickness: 0 mm 
> This dissables the thickness limmet and uses the number of layers instead. 5 0.2 mm layers = 1 mm thick

- [ ] Top surface pattern: Monotonic Line
> Depending on the model and desired top surface finish. These can be interesting to play with. 

- [ ] Bottom surface pattern: Monotonic Line

- [ ] Bottom shell thickness: 0 mm
> This disables the thickness limit and uses the number of layers instead. 5 0.2 mm layers = 1 mm thick

- [ ] Bottom surface pattern: Monotonic Line

### Infill 
---
- [ ] Sparse infill density: 10%
> Again, depending on desired strength. the majority of model strength is derived from the wall not the infill.

- [ ] Sparse infill pattern: Gyroid
> Personal: use for most models. Lightweight and quick models use adaptive cubic.

- [ ] Infill combination

<details>
  <summary>Supports</summary> 
I avoid using supports as much as possible, however when I do I use the following settings. 
The following is my thougtht process:



Identify the areas needing support
- is the area a direct line from the build plate?
- is the area not in a direct line to the build plate?

If the supports do not need to be routed around other parts, I prefer standard supports.

If the model requires significant support, I refer tree supports.

### If the model is printed in PLA and I have a multi material system available, I will change the support interface layer to PETG
-PLA will not bond to PETG, this allows for easy removal of the support interface layer.

<Callout type="CAUTION">

If you attempt to use PETG with PLA supports, the PLA may [JAM](/Troubleshooting) your hotend.

### Others 
---
- [ ] Brim type: Mouse ear (if needed)
> This places small tabs on sections of a print that may lift due to internal tension. These are very easy to remove.


- [ ] Verbose G-code

- [ ] Label objects

- [ ] Exclude objects
> if the printer supports the feature, during the print of multiple models, this feature allows you to skip a model that failed and continue printing the other without losing progress.
