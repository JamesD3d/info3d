# [TINKERCAD]() 
Tinkercad is a free browser-based 3d Creation suit operated by Autodesk

<Callout type="TIP">

In my personal openion tinkercad is one of the most useful tools for young people, education and getting started with 3d Printing and Design.

- Classroom Tutorial and Lesson Plans
- Browserbased with iPad AR

### 3d Design 
Positive and Negitve Shapes are combind to make bodies. 

There is also a text input and QR Code Generator.

### Circuits
This simulation enviroments allows you to prototype and program arduino and microbit micro controllers.

Blockcoding and Text is avaliable and can be loaded and ran directly on an Arduino or Microbit board.

### Codeblocks
Codeblocks created 3d models using block based coding. This is a great tool to explore mathamatical concepts like the fibonacci sequence.
