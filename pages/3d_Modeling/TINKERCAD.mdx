# [TINKERCAD]() 
Tinkercad is a free browser-based 3D creation suite operated by Autodesk.

<Callout type="default">

In my personal opinion, Tinkercad is one of the most useful tools for young people, education, and getting started with 3D printing and design.

## Feature Overview 
- 3D Design
- Circuits
- Codeblocks
- Sim Lab
- Classroom tutorial and lesson plans
- Browser-based with iPad AR

### 3D Design 
Positive and negative shapes are combined to make bodies.

There is also a text input and QR code generator.

Once modeled, the object can be exported as a .OBJ, .STL, .GLTF, or .SVG, as well as exported to Fusion 360.

3D Simulation

### Circuits
This simulation environment allows you to prototype and program Arduino and micro:bit microcontrollers.

Block coding and text are available and can be loaded and run directly on an Arduino or micro:bit board.

### Codeblocks
Codeblocks create 3D models using block-based coding. This is a great tool to explore mathematical concepts like the Fibonacci sequence.
