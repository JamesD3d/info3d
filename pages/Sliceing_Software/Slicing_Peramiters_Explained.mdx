My personal recommendations using my preferred slicer Orca slicer

</Callout>




## Quality
---
 [ ]  Layer height: 0.2mm

 [ ]  First Layer height 0.2mm

### Line width
---
- In most cases I update these to 0.6mm this is 120% of the nozzle size and can reduce printtime and increase strength. 

 [ ] For detail and text I leave the default settings.

### Seam position
---
 [ ] Aligned / Rear

 [ ] Scarf joint on all seams.

### Wall Generator
---
 [ ] Arachne

### Walls and surfaces 
---
 [ ] Inner/Outer/Inner

 [ ] Small area flow compensation(beta)

### Bridging 
---
 [ ] Thick external bridges

 [ ] Thick internal bridges

 [ ] Extra bridge layers(beta)

Bridge counterbore holes
 [ ] Sacrificial layer 
    > also helps with support removal.

### Overhangs
---
 [ ] Extra perimeters on overhangs.


## Strength 
---
### Wall Loops:
---  
> I increase this for desired strength.
 [ ] Wall Loops : 3

 [ ] Alternate Extra Walls


### Top/bottom shells
 [ ] Top shelly layers: 5

 [ ] Top shell thickness: 0mm (
> this dissables the thicknes limmet and uses he number of layers instead. 5 0.2mm layers = 1mm thick) 

 [ ] Top surface pattern: Monotonic Line
> Depending on the model and desired top surface finish. These can be interesting to play with. 

 [ ] Bottom surface pattern: Monotonic Line

 [ ] Bottom shell thickness: 0mm
> this dissables the thicknes limmet and uses he number of layers instead. 5 0.2mm layers = 1mm thick) 

 [ ] Bottom surface pattern: Monotonic Line

### Infill 
---
 [ ] Sparse infill density: 10%
> again depending on desired strength. the majority of model strength is derived from the wall not the infill.

 [ ] Sparse infill pattern: Gyroid
> Personal: use for most models, light weight and quick models use adaptive cubic.

 [ ] Infill combination

  <summary>Supports</summary> 
I avoid using supports as much as possible, however when I do I use the following settings. 
The following is my thougth process:



### Identifiy the areas need for support
- is the area a direct line from the build plate?
- is the area not in a direct line to the build plate?

### If the suppots dot not need to be roughted around other parts, I prefer standard dupports

### If the model requres significat support, I referr tree supports. 

### If the model is printed in PLA and I have a multi materal system avaliable, I will change the support interface layer to PETG 
-PLA will not bond to PETG, this allows for easy removal of the support interface layer.

>  ! If you atempt to use PETG with PLA Supports, the PLA may [JAM](/Troubleshooting) your hotend.

### Others 
---
- [ ]Brim type: Mouse ear (if needed)
> this places small tabs on sections of a print that may lif due to internal tension. These are very easy to remove. 

 [ ] Verbose Gcode

 [ ] Label objects

 [ ] Exclude objects
> if the printer supports the feature. During the print of multiplul models , this feature allows you to skip a model that failed and continue printing the other without loosing progress.
